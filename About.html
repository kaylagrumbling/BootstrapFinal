        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>


          After almost 40 years in business, you could say that Monte Cello’s has built a reputation as one of the
          premier Italian Restaurant chains in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, the owners and operators don’t want to
          take any of the success for granted. That’s one of the reasons why they continue to strive to make each and
          every dining experience unique and satisfying.


          More than 175 million slices of mouth-watering pizza have been sold since the first Monte Cello’s restaurant
          opened its doors in the North Hills. Since those modest beginnings, the group has expanded to six inviting
          restaurants from Cranberry down to the Ross Township location .


          Today’s fast-paced dining out market is dominated by pre-packaged, unspectacular pizza, but not here at Monte
          Cello’s. Monte Cello’s pizzas are all hand-made, using only the freshest local ingredients. In fact, all of
          Monte Cello’s menu items are made with only the highest-quality recipes by the finest of hands.


          Founders Joe Wadlow and Domenic Ricci, along with everyone at Monte Cello’s, want to make your special night
          out to be fantastic. That’s why they keep your family’s budget in mind, all the while refusing to sacrifice
          quality or taste. It’s that attention to detail that sets Monte Cello’s Restaurants apart from everyone else.


          Give yourself a treat and check out a Monte Cello’s in your area tonight!
