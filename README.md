I emulated a restaurant website of a place near me. I used Bootstrap to add a carousel, form, table, and nav bar to my website. The first JavaScript I wrote would display an alert on the page when the button is pressed. The second JavaScript I wrote would create a pop up when the page was opened that would say enjoy your visit. The third JavaScript I wrote would make my nav bar responsive. The fourth JavaScript I wrote would make the image change when hovered over it. The fifth JavaScript I wrote would make the image change back when no longer hovered over it. The sixth JavaScript I wrote would make form validation for the form on my website.
